      "description": "Living with mental illness is a challenge, and often the effects of living with mental health challenges extend to friends and family. A person affected by mental health conditions faces the ups and downs on the road to recoveryâ€”from diagnosis and treatment to managing their wellness to balancing work, school and mental health.
