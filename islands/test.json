      "description": "Living with mental illness is a challenge, and often the effects of living with mental health challenges extend to friends and family. A person affected by mental health conditions faces the ups and downs on the road to recovery—from diagnosis and treatment to managing their wellness to balancing work, school and mental health. But more often than not, the journey on that road to recovery can involve parents, siblings, partners, grandparents and children, too. 

      Some families can be completely overwhelmed by the experience, while others deny the situation entirely. Many times families are strengthened and unified, which can even extend to the community beyond the family and generate understanding for others who face the road to recovery. 
      
      This \“roadmap\” is meant to provide families and individuals with mental health conditions help and hope for living in a world affected by mental health challenges, from an overview of symptoms to navigating the health system in the Puget Sound area. People in recovery who live with mental illness and their families can be an influential force that can inspire their communities, fight stigma and transform the state of mental health care. Together, we can advocate for an array of readily available resources designed to meet the diverse needs of persons with mental health conditions and their families.
