People with bipolar have high and low moods, known as mania and depression, which differ from the typical ups and downs most people experience.  Not everyone's symptoms are the same and the severity can vary.  Because of its irregular patterns, bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose.  Although bipolar disorder can occur at any point in life, the average age of onset is 25."

The first thing to do if you feel your health is worsening is to call your mental health professionals and inform them of what's going on.  Don't be afraid to speak openly and honestly.  Your treatment provider can help make adjustments to your treatment---whether that be with medication, additional therapy appointments, or something else---to help you re-stabilize before a crisis occurs.  It is especially important to reach out for help and support if you are feeling suicidal.  If you or someone else is at risk for suicide, call the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 as soon as possible.  They have trained counselors available to speak with you 24/7 and assist in a crisis situation."
