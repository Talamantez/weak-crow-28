                "text": "A mental health advance directive (MHAD) is a written legal document describing what you want to have happen if you become so incapacitated by mental illness that your judgement is impaired and/or you are unable to communicate effectively. It can inform others about what treatment you want or don't want, and can identify a person to whom you have given the authority to make decisions on your behalf. An MHAD is entirely voluntary and is intended to honor the treatment choices of the individual with a mental illness if a crisis strikes."
