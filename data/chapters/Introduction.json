A person affected by mental health conditions faces the ups and downs on the road to recoveryâ€”from diagnosis and treatment to managing their wellness to balancing work, school and mental health. But more often than not, the journey on that road to recovery can involve parents, siblings, partners, grandparents and children, too."
